Hi there! Thanks for helping out in improving Eightshift Libs.

## Reporting an issue

If you are not sure how something works be sure to read our [readme](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-libs/blob/master/README.md) and [wiki](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-libs/wiki). If you found a bug in the code, please [open an issue](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-libs/issues/new) and follow the instructions in the issue template.

## Contributing patches and new features

If you found a bug and want to fix it, or you want to add some new and cool feature, [fork](https://github.com/infinum/wp-boilerplate#fork-destination-box) our repository, then create a `feature` branch from the `master` branch. For instance `feature/some-bug-fix` or `feature/some-cool-new-feature`.

Once you've coded things up, be sure you check that your code is following our [coding standards](https://github.com/infinum/coding-standards-wp). Also test that your code isn't breaking anything :)

Then submit a pull request to `develop` branch. Once we check everything we'll merge the changes into `master` with correct version correction (noted by the milestone flag and `future release` tag).

## Integration testing

If you want to create integration tests for your code that would be great. We will add some in due time, and they are not necessary for a PR.
